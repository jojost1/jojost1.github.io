25;CRS-8;08 Apr 16 20:43 UTC;U;ASDS Attempt;7300kg?;LEO;F9 v1.2;Dragon;CC LC40;Upcoming Launch!;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pUAydjne5M;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh8V0COrrzE;;Eighth Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission, sending Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS). Carrying Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) in the trunk. Expected barge landing attempt.;
#24;SES-9;04 Mar 16;Y;ASDS Attempt;5530kg;GTO;F9 v1.2;Fairing;CC LC40;Heaviest Non-Dragon Payload F9;https://youtu.be/muDPSyO7-A0?t=9m27s;https://youtu.be/sIkPP2LM8DU?t=9m30s;;Eighth comsat to GTO. Payload mass of 5330 kg, the heaviest non-Dragon satellite SpaceX has launched to date. Attempted barge landing, but the booster unfortunately "landed hard". Landing success was not expected however, as the propellant margins for this flight were very low due to the high energy demands of the orbit.;
#23;Jason-3;17 Jan 16;Y;ASDS Attempt;553kg;PO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;VAFB LC4E;Final F9 v1.1 Flight;https://youtu.be/ivdKRJzl6y0?t=21m16s;https://youtu.be/vkz_lclGXNg?t=21m19s;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jshk8ZVIgdI;Earth observation satellite to Polar Orbit. Launching from Vandenberg SLC-4E, this was the last flight of Falcon 9 v1.1 - all flights after Jason-3 will use the upgraded Falcon 9 v1.2. Third mission in which a post-flight barge landing was attempted. The booster successfully touched down softly on the barge, but as the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, the booster subsequently toppled over onto the deck and exploded.;
#22;First Falcon 9 Landing;21 Dec 15;S;RTLS Success;N/A;N/A;F9 v1.2;N/A;CC LC40;Special Patch;;;;A special patch for the first successful landing of a Falcon 9 first stage.
#21;OG2 Launch 2;21 Dec 15;Y;RTLS Success;1892kg;LEO;F9 v1.2;Fairing;CC LC40;First RTLS Landing;https://youtu.be/O5bTbVbe4e4?t=22m33s;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCBE8ocOkAQ;Falcon 9's Return to Flight after the CRS-7 failure, carrying out a second mission for Orbcomm, taking the remaining 11 of 17 OG2 satellites to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). First flight of the upgraded "Falcon 9 v1.2" booster, with higher thrust engines, supercooled propellants and an elongated second stage. This launch marked the first ever time that an orbit-capable rocket booster returned to the launch site, and propulsively touched down safely on solid ground.;
#20;CRS-7;28 Jun 15;N;-;6654kg;LEO;F9 v1.1;Dragon;CC LC40;First Falcon 9 Failure;https://youtu.be/PuNymhcTtSQ?t=28s;;;Seventh CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. Falcon 9 experienced an anomaly 139 seconds into the flight, which resulted in a total loss of mission. The cause of failure was a strut in the second stage that held a helium cylinder in place. The strut failed far below its expected tolerance, causing a catastrophic release of helium, which caused massive overpressure, resulting in the structural disintegration of the second stage. Following this, Falcon 9 auto-terminated in the skies over Cape Canaveral. No one was injured.;
#19;Dragon 2 Pad Abort;06 May 15;S;N/A;N/A;N/A;Dragon 2;Dragon;CC LC40;Special Patch;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FXVjf46T8;;;While a flight-like Dragon V2 and trunk were used for the pad abort test, they rested atop a truss structure for the test rather than a full Falcon 9 rocket. A crash test dummy embedded with a suite of sensors was placed inside the test vehicle to record acceleration loads and forces at the crew seat, while the remaining six seats were loaded with weights to simulate full-passenger-load weight. The test objective was to demonstrate sufficient total impulse, thrust and controllability to conduct a safe pad abort. The vehicle splashed down safely in the ocean to the east of the launchpad 99 seconds later. A fuel mixture ratio issue was detected after the flight in one of the eight SuperDraco engines, but did not materially affect the flight.;
#18;Turkmen√Ñlem 52E;27 Apr 15;Y;-;4707kg;GTO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;Record Turnaround: 13 Days;;;;Seventh comsat to GTO. Notably heavy satellite, at 4707 kg. Turnaround time of 13 days, 2 hours, 53 mins, the current SpaceX record. No booster landing attempt.;
#17;CRS-6;14 Apr 15;Y;ASDS Attempt;2015kg;LEO;F9 v1.1;Dragon;CC LC40;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csVpa25iqH0;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAzwuEmZcmE;Sixth CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. Second mission in which a post-flight barge landing was attempted. On descent, the booster experienced an issue with "stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag." The booster hit the barge too hard, and and not perfectly upright, and so toppled over shortly afterwards, and exploded on the deck.;
#16;Eutelsat 115W B + ABS-3A;01 Mar 15;Y;-;4159kg;GTO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;;;;;Two communication satellites to GTO, the first time SpaceX have launched two large comsats at once. No booster landing attempt.;
#15;DSCOVR;11 Feb 15;Y;ASDS Attempt;570kg;L1;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;;;;;First launch to Earth-Sun L1, first launch of a science mission for NASA. Final orbit has an apogee of 1,171,345 km, currently the furthest SpaceX has travelled from Earth. Second mission in which a post-flight barge landing was to be attempted, but stormy weather forced the barge to retreat, scuppering this plan. Instead, the first stage made a soft touchdown to a targeted point in the ocean.;
#14;CRS-5;10 Jan 15;Y;ASDS Attempt;2317kg;LEO;F9 v1.1;Dragon;CC LC40;First ASDS Landing Attempt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7x-SumbynI;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7EXf2Sr7k;Fifth CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. First mission in which a post-flight barge landing was attempted. Unfortunately, the first stage prematurely ran out of grid fin hydraulic fluid, causing it to lose attitude control. Though it was perfectly on target towards the barge, it was pitched at too steep an angle, and so hit the barge hard.;
#13;CRS-4;21 Sep 14;Y;-;2216kg;LEO;F9 v1.1;Dragon;CC LC40;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YkCh7uOw1Y;;;Fourth CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. Turnaround in just 14 days. The first stage made a soft touchdown in the ocean. NASA recorded infra-red footage of the booster during its reentry, as the data may provide critical engineering information for future missions to the surface of Mars.;
#12;AsiaSat 6;07 Sep 14;Y;-;3700kg;GTO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;;;;;Fourth comsat delivered to GTO. An initial delay as a result of the F9R-Dev1 incident caused some doubt as to whether SpaceX could keep up their new-found launch cadence, but despite this, they managed a turnaround time of just over a month. No booster landing attempt.;
#11;AsiaSat 8;05 Aug 14;Y;-;4535kg;GTO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;;;;;Third comsat delivered to GTO. Notably heavy satellite, at 4535 kg. Turnaround time of just three weeks. No booster landing attempt.;
#10;OG2 Launch 1;14 Jul 14;Y;Soft ocean landing;1032kg;LEO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;;;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQnR5fhCXkQ;First mission for Orbcomm. After months of delays, the legged F9 lifts the first 6 of 17 OG2 satellites to LEO. Boost stage survives down to ocean again, but is destroyed on contact with water.;
#9;CRS-3;18 Apr 14;Y;Soft ocean landing;2089kg;LEO;F9 v1.1;Dragon;CC LC40;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc_2nBsk4QU;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZ33C9JZTM;Third CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. This was the first flight with landing legs attached to the booster. Coupled with "beefed-up RCS", these changes prevented the roll problem seen with Cassiope. The booster touched down with a soft landing in the Atlantic Ocean, but heavy waves destroyed it before the recovery boats could reach it.;
#8;Thaicom 6;06 Jan 14;Y;-;3016kg;GTO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;;;;;Second comsat to GTO, with a turnaround time of just over one month. No booster landing attempt.;
#7;SES-8;03 Dec 13;Y;-;3170kg;GTO;F9 v1.1;Fairing;CC LC40;First Mission Beyond LEO;;;;F9 v1.1 delivers a telecommunications satellite to GTO, the first SpaceX mission beyond LEO. No booster landing attempt.;
#6;CASSIOPE;29 Sep 13;Y;-;500kg;PO;F9 v1.1; Fairing; VAFB LC4E;First F9 v1.1 Flight;;;;First flight of the redesigned Falcon 9 v1.1, lofting the CASSIOPE satellite into a Polar Orbit from Vandenburg Air Force Base. This was the first flight in which SpaceX attempted to propulsively "land" the first stage booster following on from stage separation. Unfortunately, the stage began to roll as it descended, centrifuging the fuel, and so starving the landing engine. The landing burn terminated early, and the booster impacted the ocean surface hard.;
#5;CRS-2;01 Mar 13;Y;-;677kg;LEO;F9 v1.0;Dragon;CC LC40;Final F9 v1.0 Flight;;;;Second CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. Thruster issues with Dragon in orbit solved in real-time by teams on the ground. Final flight of the Falcon 9 v1.0.;
#4;CRS-1 + OG2 Demo;07 Oct 12;P;-;400kg;LEO;F9 v1.0;Dragon;CC LC40;;;;;First CRS mission, sending Dragon to the ISS. Falcon 9 suffered engine loss 80 seconds into flight. Falcon 9 has double engine failure redundancy so the mission was not jeopardized. However, due to the engine failure the secondary payload (an Orbcomm satellite) was not placed into its intended orbit. ISS safety rules precluded an engine restart to remedy this.;
#3;COTS 2;22 May 12;Y;-;525kg;LEO;F9 v1.0;Dragon;CC LC40;;;;;Second Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) demo flight, carrying Dragon to LEO, with subsequent ISS rendezvous and berthing. SpaceX becomes first private company to deliver a payload to the ISS.;
#2;COTS 1;08 Dec 10;Y;-;333.4kg;LEO;F9 v1.0;Dragon;CC LC40;;;;;First COTS demo flight, carrying a fully-functional Dragon capsule to LEO. Dragon later deorbited and recovered from the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX becomes first private company to put spaceship in orbit and then recover it safely.;
#1;Demo Flight;04 Jun 10;Y;-;N/A;LEO;F9 v1.0;Dragon;CC LC40;First F9 Flight;;;;Maiden flight of the Falcon 9 v1.0, carrying a boilerplate Dragon to LEO.;
#-1;RazakSat;14 Jul 09;Y;-;200kg;LEO;F1;Fairing;Kwajalein;Last F1 Flight;;;;Earth imaging satellite delivered to LEO. Final flight of the Falcon 1.;
#-2;RatSat;28 Sep 08;Y;-;165kg;LEO;F1;Fairing;Kwajalein;First F1 Success;;;;Boilerplate satellite delivered to LEO. SpaceX becomes the first private company to successfully achieve orbit with a liquid-fueled rocket.;
#-3;Trailblazer i.a.;03 Aug 08;N;-;91.5kg;LEO;F1;Fairing;Kwajalein;;;;;First flight with the redesigned Merlin 1C engine. During stage separation, residual thrust caused the first stage to collide with the second stage, damaging the second stage engine beyond operation.;
#-4;DemoSat;21 Mar 07;P;-;Unknown;LEO;F1;Fairing;Kwajalein;;;;;Harmonic oscillations during second stage flight caused a premature engine shutdown, falling short of orbit.;
#-5;FalconSat-2;24 Mar 06;N;-;19.5kg;LEO;F1;Fairing;Kwajalein;First F1 Flight;;;;Maiden flight of the Falcon 1. Saltwater corrosion caused an engine failure 25 seconds into flight.;
